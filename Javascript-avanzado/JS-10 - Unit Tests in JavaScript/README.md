# JS - 10 Unit Tests in JavaScript

 <br/>
 <br/>

## Part 1: Verify and Run Tests
1. Download the file and navigate using the terminal inside the *js* folder.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies using NPM:
 ```bash
   npm install
 ```
3. Run the unit tests and verify the results:
 ```bash
   npm test
 ```
4. Open the *js* folder on Visual Studio Code and verify the existing test.
 
## Part 2: Implement Calculator test
1. Implement 2 unit tests for the *divide* function.
2. Implement 2 unit tests for the *multiply* function.

## Part 3: Implement UserController test
1. Implement 1 test for the *add* function that verifies a user that is not in the users' list.
2. Implement 1 test for the *remove* function that verifies a user that is not in the users' list.
3. Implement 2 unit tests for the *findByEmail* function.
4. Implement 2 unit tests for the *findById* function.

## Challenge Yourself
In Test Driven Development you write the first test that fails, and then you add the code so test can pass.
1. Write a unit test to verify the function *divide* by passing 0 as the second argument.
2. Fix the divide function so the test passes and it does handle the case for division by 0.
